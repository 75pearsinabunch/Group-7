  <h1>Popcorn</h1>
		<img src= ../../img/pop.jpg alt="Popcorn" class="center">
  <h2>Ingredients:<h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup of popping corn kernels</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
				<li>1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter</li>
				<li>Fine salt</li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Directions:<h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Put stick of butter in a glass measuring cup. You’ll need to use the spout later.</li>
			<li>Microwave on high for 30-40 seconds, or until the butter is all melted and foamy.</li>
			<li>Let the butter cool for 1-2 minutes. You should start to see the butter separating into three layers—foam, clarified butter, and milk solids.</li>
			<li>Take a spoon and skim off as much of the foam on top as you can. Again, no need to be perfect.</li>
			<li>You’ll be left with a very clear, very yellow layer of clarified butter, with a layer of milk solids underneath. </li>
			<li>When it’s time to dress your popcorn, pour the clear, yellow clarified butter onto the popcorn, leaving the milk solids behind.</li>
		</ol>
