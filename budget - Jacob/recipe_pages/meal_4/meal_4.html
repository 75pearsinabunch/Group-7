  <h1>Chicken Sorrento!</h1>
  <h2>Tips!<h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for a pasta alternative, serve the chicken over creamy polenta or mashed potatoes instead of pasta.
</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:<h2>
    <ul>
       <li>8 ounces uncooked penne pasta (about 2 1/2 cups)</li>
       <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast (4 small or 2 large, cut in half crosswise)</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
       <li> 1 jar (24 ounces) Prego® Traditional Italian Sauce or Prego® Chunky Tomato, Onion & Garlic Italian Sauce</li>
       <li> 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
       <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Directions:<h2>
    <p>Step 1
        Cook and drain the penne according to the package directions.  While the penne is cooking,
        season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat
         (to prevent sticking, make sure the skillet and oil are hot before adding the chicken).  Add the chicken
         and cook for at least 3 minutes before turning (if it doesn't turn easily give it another minute on that side)
         then cook until both sides are well browned.  Remove the chicken from the skillet.

        Step 2
        Stir the sauce and vinegar in the skillet and cook for 2 minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the basil.
        Return the chicken to the skillet.  Reduce the heat to low.  Cover and cook for 5 minutes or until the chicken is done.

        Step 3
        Slice the chicken.  Serve the chicken and sauce over the cooked penne.  Sprinkle with the cheese.</p>
