  <h1>Microwave Mac and Cheese!</h1>
  <h2>Tips!<h2>
    <p>Cooking time will vary greatly depending on your microwave and the width and
      depth of the mug.Always keep a close eye on your mug while in the microwave so
      it doesn’t overflow or overcook.
    </p>
  <h2>Ingredients:<h2>
    <ul>
       <li>⅓ cup (28g/1oz) pasta</li>
       <li>¾ cup (175ml/6fl oz) water, cold</li>
       <li>4 tablespoons milk</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon cornstarch (aka cornflour)</li>
       <li>4 tablespoons cheddar cheese , grated</li>
       <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions:<h2>
    <p>In a large microwavable mug or large bowl add in the macaroni and the water.
       You need a large mug as the water will boil up.
       Microwave for roughly 3 ½ minutes. You want the pasta to be fully cooked.
       (Timing is based on my 1200w microwave so your timing might vary)
       Pour off the remaining cooking water.
       Stir in the milk, cornstarch and shredded cheese and microwave for a final
       60 seconds to create your sauce. Stir well, season with salt and pepper
       and enjoy.</p>
