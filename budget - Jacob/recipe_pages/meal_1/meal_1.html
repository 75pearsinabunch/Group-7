  <h1>Slow Cooker Stew!</h1>
	<img class="img" src="../img/meal_1.webp">
  <h2>Tips!<h2>
    <p>Fresh vegetables – I bought just what I needed for this recipe though you can buy large bags of potatoes and carrots and your price will go down.
      Look for ground beef a roll, it’s almost always cheaper than beef in trays.
      Dried spices are alway cheaper than fresh and last for years for other recipes as well.
      I use water instead of broth in this recipe to cut down on the cost, though broth can be used if desired.

  <h2>Ingredients:<h2>
    <ul>
       <li>1 lb. ground beef browned and drained</li>
       <li>1.5 lbs potatoes, diced large</li>
       <li>3 carrots, sliced</li>
       <li>1 onion, diced</li>
       <li>1 garlic clove minced (I had this on hand already)</li>
       <li>6 oz. can tomato paste</li>
       <li>2 cups water</li>
       <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
       <li>¼ tsp. pepper</li>
       <li>1 tsp. onion powder</li>
       <li>1 tsp. dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Directions:<h2>
    <p>Brown the beef in a skillet on the stove-top, drain fat.
       Add the beef to the slow cooker along with the potatoes,
       onions, carrots, and garlic.
       In a small bowl whisk together the tomato paste, water, salt, pepper,
       onion powder, and oregano. Pour this mixture over everything in the
       slow cooker. Stir.Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on low
       for 7-8 hours or until the potatoes are tender.
       Serve in bowls and enjoy!</p>
