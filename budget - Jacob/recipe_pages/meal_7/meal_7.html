  <h1>Lemon Quinoa and Egg Bowls with Veggies and Sirracha</h1>
	<img class="img" src="../img/15_meal_1.jpg">
  <h2>Tips!<h2>
    <p>For easy meals throughout the week, prepare the lemony quinoa and veggies over the weekend. Then simply prepare an egg to top your bowl.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:<h2>
    <ul>
         <li>1.5 c. tri-color quinoa</li>
         <li>3/4 c. lemon juice</li>
         <li>3 T. honey</li>
         <li>1/3 c. extra virgin olive oil</li>
         <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
         <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
         <li>1.5 c. shredded carrots</li>
         <li>1.5 c. thinly sliced snow peas</li>
         <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
         <li>4 eggs, prepared in your favorite way</li>
         <li>sriracha sauce</li>
         <li>4 green onions, sliced thinly on the diagonal</li>
         <li>black sesame seeds</li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Directions:<h2>
    <p>Cook quinoa according to package directions. Set aside.
        In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, honey, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Stir half of the lemon mixture into the quinoa and set the rest aside.
        In a small pan on the stove top, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add shredded carrots and cook for 1 to 2 minutes to slightly soften. Drain and then place carrots on a paper towel to dry. If you like your carrots crunchy, skip this step and just add the carrots raw.
        To assemble, stir more of the lemon mixture into the quinoa if desired. Then divide quinoa between four bowls. Top with carrots, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Then add an egg that has been prepared in your favorite fashion – fried, poached, hard boiled, soft boiled, scrambled – to each of the four bowls. Drizzle a bit of sriracha sauce over the top and sprinkle with green onions and black sesame seeds.</p>
